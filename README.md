Color-based approach to modelling 2D images into 2D+Extrusions

Current issues with color as an indication of depth:
- Not always indicating more/less depth as it could just indicate the color of an object

Assumptions:
- Assume that from this one point of view that color is representative of depth
- If color is representative of depth from this point of view, there exists a mapping of color to the 2D image that produces the correct output.
