## Some Common Methods
Depth analysis

3D point cloud -> 3D model (why is this difficult?)

Shape Grammar to identify different parts of the building facade

#### Shape Grammar Parsing via Reinforcement Learning

Teboul - 2011 - [link](http://vision.mas.ecp.fr/Personnel/teboul/files/cvpr11_teboul.pdf)

#### Single View Reconstruction Using Shape Grammars for Urban Environments

Teboul - 2009 - [link](http://vision.mas.ecp.fr/Personnel/teboul/files/iccv09_teboul.pdf)

#### Detecting and inferring repetitive elements with accurate locations and shapes from fa√ßades

Lian - 2017 - [link](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00371-017-1355-z)

  - Looks at repeated elements (such as windows) to find features
  - How? Full paper not found. Requested

#### Modeling and Rendering Architecture from Photographs: A hybrid geometry- and image-based approach

Debevec - 1996 - [link](http://inst.cs.berkeley.edu/~cs283/fa10/lectures/debevec-siggraph96-paper.pdf) **MUST READ**

  - One of the oldest papers found so far
  - Does 2d image to 3d modelling
  - 2 different types of procedures involved?
    - photogrammetric and geometric modelling
    -
#### Inverse Procedural Modelling of Facade Layout

Wu - 2014 - [link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.0419.pdf)

  - 2: Related Work
    - procedural modelling: contains some links to paper which allow user controls when defining shape grammar.
    - Procedural vs Inverse Procedural?

#### Image-Based Modeling and Photo Editing

Oh - 2007 - [link](http://graphics.cs.yale.edu/site/sites/files/p433-oh.pdf)
  - uses depth analysis for more than just architecture

#### Statistical Relational Learning of Grammar Rules for 3D Building Reconstruction **MUST READ**

Dehbi - 2106 - http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tgis.12200/full

  - SVMs and MLNs
  - Learning the grammars applied in other papers
  -

#### Constrained Procedural Modelling of Real Buildings from Single Facade Layout

Udaya - 2016 - [link](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Divya_Udayan_J/publication/312083662_Constrained_Procedural_Modeling_of_Real_Buildings_from_Single_Facade_Layout/links/586e4d3d08ae329d6213a177.pdf)

  - uses facdae image and footprint
  - reconstructs a 3d building model
  - "Although a fully automated solutions for facade encoding exist, to the best of our knowledge, no framework allows for generation of a complete building from the fa- cade and the building footprint." - introduction
    - What??? It already exists??
  - overall, the paper is more concerned over the footprint for large scale automated city modelling

#### Statistical relational learning of semantic models and grammar rules for 3D building reconstruction from 3D point clouds **long read**

Bonn - 2016 - [link](http://hss.ulb.uni-bonn.de/2016/4532/4532a.pdf)

  - Not 2d to 3d. Instead its 3d point cloud to 3d. Could be useful later on.
