# LabelMeFacade - Creation Scripts

This is a pretty old perl script we once upon a time used to create the dataset from LabelMe images.
There is no gurantee that it still works (which is pretty unlikely), however, it might give you some information
about how the dataset was created.

## Modules

The only module required is `Tie::Persistent`

    install them with e.g.
    perl -MCPAN -eshell
    install Tie::Persistent
